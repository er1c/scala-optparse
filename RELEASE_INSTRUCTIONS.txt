# 1 - SETUP CREDENTIALS

  # Create a ~/.sbt/0.13/sonatype.sbt file with the following:
  credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
                             "oss.sonatype.org",
                             "your-sonatype-username",
                             "your-sonatype-password")

# 2a - TO PUBLISH A SINGLE SCALA VERSION (e.g. a new version of Scala comes out)

  # Switch to whatever version you want to deploy (if not deploying all)
  ++ 2.11.0

  # Make sure tests pass
  test

  # Publish
  publish-signed


# 2b - TO PUBLISH ALL SCALA VERSIONS (e.g. new scala-optparse features or version)

  # Make sure tests pass
  + test

  # Publish
  + publish-signed

# 3 - RELEASE (also see http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html)

  - Log into https://oss.sonatype.org/
  - Select "Staging Repositories"
  - Select the proper entry (e.g. comfrugalmechanic-1000) which is probably at the bottom
  - Inspect the "Content" tab to make sure everything looks good
  - Click the "Close" button at the top of the "Staging Repositories" tab
  - Click the "Release" button to actually perform the release
  - The new version should show up here: http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/frugalmechanic/
  - It should also get synced to Maven Central within a few hours
